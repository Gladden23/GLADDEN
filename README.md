# About

I am Gladden Ogbale. I have an analytical background in pure Mathematics, and I currently hold a BSc in Mathematics.  I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills from my field of study (mathematics) to Data Analysis as a data analyst expert.
