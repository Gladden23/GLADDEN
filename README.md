# About

I am Gladden Ogbale. I have an analytical background in pure Mathematics, and I currently hold a BSc in Mathematics.  I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills from my field of study (mathematics) to Data Analysis as a data analyst expert.  

I've always been fascinated by numbers, and working in data analytics has been a long-term goal of mine. My analytical background in Mathematics has taught me to think strategically about problems and identify solutions. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills by training young people on how to utilize data skills to solve life related problem spanning accross diferent industries.
